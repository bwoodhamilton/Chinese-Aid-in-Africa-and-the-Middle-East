Contract details reveal 35 per cent of the total investment would be paid in cash by the Nigerian side within a month, with the remaining 65 per cent taking the form of loans. The loan stipulates $114.9 million for the project's 335MW power plant, signed in 2002, at 6% interest, a grace period of 6 years, maturity in 12 years.The total cost of the project was $359.71 million, with a Chinese commitment of $297.75 million funded by the Export-Import Bank of China. Additional funding may have come from the Nigeria Power and Steel Department. The plant was put into operation in 2007. Nigerian former president Obasanjo stated in 2007 that Papalanto, as well as Chinese-financed Omotosho, were generating power for Nigeria's electricity grid in May 2007. The project was expanded, with SEPCO III securing both the original and expansion contracts, and completion was scheduled for June 2010. As part of the deal, the Nigerian Government agreed to pay for Chinese companies to help manage the power plants after construction is completed in two years' time. A 2009 article from the Centre for Chinese Studies indicated that the turbines were still under construction at that time and that the loans were backed with oil from Nigeria. In 2011, SEPCO_„Žs Project Manager, Mr Li Xianlai, visited the power plant and faulted lack of expertise on the part of the PHCN_„Žs personnel as the reason that only six of the eight turbines were working.

2007,"Export-Import Bank of China, Government Agency",Ghana,Bui Dam Complex (linked to project ID #30801),"As per Brautigam's article and other sources: In 2007 China agreed to finance the 400 MW Bui Dam, on the Black Volta river at the southern end of Bui National Park in Ghana. The dam was financed by two separately negotiated China Exim bank loans. One was a commercial export buyers_„Ž credit of US$292 million with 12 years_„Ž maturity, a grace period of five years and an interest rate set at a margin of 1.075 per cent over the prevailing Commercial Interest Reference Rates (CIRR). The other, with a fixed interest rate of 2 per cent, appeared to be either a concessional loan or a preferential export credit, for about US$270 million. Development Assistance Committee rules recommend that a mixed credit like this be reported separately: _„ƒone for the _„ñsoft_„ loan [ODA] and one for the commercial loan [OOF]. _„ƒTied aid_„Ž like this is allowed under OECD rules for projects that cannot attract commercial financing, although OECD members would be required to report the offer and its terms so that other OECD members could compete on the same terms if they were so inclined (Brautigam 2010). Just like some of China Eximbank_„Žs larger credits in countries such as Angola, the Bui Dam project finance was a resource-secured loan. In this case, it was guaranteed not through oil or minerals, but through export sales of cocoa beans. Genertec Corporation of China has a cocoa sales agreement with the Ghana Cocoa Board for up to 40 000 Mt of cocoa beans (30‘_000 main crop; 10 000 light crop) annually over the life of the loan_„îthat is, 20 years. By September of 2009, EXIM Bank had disbursed 41.73 US million dollars to Ghana for the project. China Eximbank also required Bui Hydropower to have a power purchase agreement with the Electricity Company of Ghana. The net revenue from this will be deposited into an escrow account to help repay the loan. The price for the future electricity was tentatively negotiated to be in a range between US$0.035 and US$0.055 cents kW/h (Habia 2009). The first power generating unit of 133 megawatts from the Bui hydroelectric project became operational on May 3, 2013, with plans for all 400 megawatts to come online by end of 2013. Two additional loans were made by China in 2012 for this project (ID# 30086). Sinohydro was contractor, and reports the contract total as US $596 million on its website. On May 3, 2013 President John Dramani Mahama, accompanied by a number of central and local government officials, and the Chinese Ambassador to Ghana, attended an inauguration ceremony for the dam's first turbine, with construction of the remain 3 turbines expected by the end of the year. UPDATE: The third and final generating unit of the Bui Hydroelectric Project was commissioned in December of 2013. Meanwhile, other associated and non-power works on the Project including Bui City will continue until the second quarter of 2014, when the project will be fully completed.",Export credits,OOF-like,Mixed,475239312.6,Energy Generation and Supply,Ghana
2006,"Export-Import Bank of China, Government Agency",Nigeria,Modernization of the Nigeria railway (linked to #1844),"Description: In 2002, a project for the modernization of Nigeria_„Žs railway system was proposed, which China offered to finance with a 1 billion USD soft loan from the China Exim Bank. On October 30, 2006, the Chinese Civil Engineering Construction Corporation (CCECC) and the Ministry of Transportation of Nigeria signed a contract worth 8.3 billion USD for the implementation of the Lagos-Kano Railway Modernization Project and was linked with the 2006 China-Nigeria 'Oil for Infrastructure agreement' (ID#1844). The price of the project was reduced to 8 billion USD in 2009. In September 2012, Nigeria finalized a 600 million USD loan agreement with the Export-Import Bank of China to partially fund the rail line. 500 million USD will go to the rail project, while the remaining 100 million USD will finance ICT infrastructure. The loan will be repaid at 2.5 percent interest over twenty years. The grace period on the loan is seven years. In order to release funding pressures, the project was planned to be implemented in phases. The first phase of the project includes modernizing the 186.5 km Abuja to Kaduna section of the 1,313 km railway from Lagos to Kano. The cost of the first phase is projected to be 849,750,903 USD and will be constructed over 36 months. The second phase of the project is the Lagos-Ibadan section of the railway, a double track line with a total length of 156.8km and a projected speed of 150km per hour for both passengers and freight transportation. This portion is worth approximately 1.487 billion USD with a construction period of 36 months. In July 2013, the Minister of Transportation reported that 65% of the work on the Abuja-Kaduna line had been completed, while the contract for Lagos-Ibadan double track had been signed but was pending the completion of an agreement with the China Exim bank. PPIAF-ID:206 However, Deborah Brautigam reported in December 2010 that after CCECC won the $8.3 billion contract, the Chinese government had offered a line of export credit for 2 billion USD at a competitive commercial rate, as well as a preferential export credit of 500 million USD. The 2 billion USD in export credits were considered for projects other than the railway but were never used and expired. The 500 million USD preferential credit was renewed and might be used to fund a part of the railway infrastructure project. The flow type is unknown due to contradictory sources, with Brautigam referring to the commitment as an export credit and the Nigerian government referring to it as a concessional loan. As of July 2013 this project is anywhere from 27-68% completed (different sources quote different numbers), though the source of future funding is still unclear. As of July 23, 2013 the foundation stone for the building of Lots 1A and 3 stations was laid.",Loan (excluding debt rescheduling),ODA-like,Development,919705496.5,Transport and Storage,Nigeria

Once implementation began in February 2012, estimates of the whole project costs total $704 million yuan, although Tanzania had only secured 481 million. The Tanzanian Minister of Finance and Economic Affairs Mustapha Mkulo spoke at the signing ceremony. The implementing agency for the project is Beijing Construction Engineering Group Ltd. This project was committed to at the same time as the loan for the Tanzanian National Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Broadband infrastructure Backbone Network Project which was signed at the same time. The project was discussed in the Zanzibar house of representatives in August 2013, where legislators Mbaroul Wadi Mussa and Hamza Hassan Juma expressed concern over the 'shoddy work' at the airport. The terminal's architectural problems prompted the Zanzibar government to hire ADPI France Company for further evaluation. ADPI later proved the work required re-designing. Multiple reports suggest that the loan provided for the construction of this project is concessional and from the EXIM-Bank; however, because we do not have the financial terms of the 30-yr loans, we cannot classify it as ODA.

As of 2012, only 2,000 housing units have been completed comared to the 40,000 planned for completion.Implementation of the project's first phase involves the production of 720 housing units for sale and appears to have been successfully completed. As of January 2011, the implementing agencies have concentrated their efforts on Phases 2 and 3. The implementation of the project has so far been carried out by implementing agencies China Wu Yi Corporation Limited and Ederman Properties. Construction efforts in the 'Greatwall Apartments' Complex have successfully provided Kenyan citizens with 528 apartments, as well as facilities including shops and school.

2006,"Export-Import Bank of China, Government Agency",Zimbabwe,Zimbabwe acquires Chinese agricultural support facility,"On September 14, 2006, the governments of Zimbabwe and China signed a US$200 million loan agreement to be used for agricultural support and the planned importation of 387,000 tons of Chinese fertilizer for needy Zimbabwean farmers. Agricultural uses for the US$200 million loan include the payment of agricultural equipment, chemicals, and other critical requirements. The shipment of fertilizer is expected to arrive in Zimbabwe at the beginning of October 2006 to help farmers deal with crop shortages. The loan is being facilitated by both the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe and the Export-Import Bank of China. The Zimbabwean government was represented by Gideon Gono, the governor of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, while the fertilizer agreement is a result of a visit to China made by the Vice President of Zimbabwe, Joice Mujuru, and the Zimbabwe Secretary of Economic Development, A. Bvumbe.The first consignment of fertilizer from China arrived into Zimbabwe by December 26, 2012, although the amount of fertilizer was not specified. The fertilizer in question was of Compound Types D, S, C, and L. On February 1, 2007, Samuel Muvuti, acting chief executive of the state-owned Zimbabwe Grain Marketing Board, announced that a second shipment of 13,000 tonnes of fertilizer procured through the US$200 million loan was delivered to Zimbabwe via Mozambique from China with 8,000 tonnes still in transit and 14,000 tonnes awaiting transportation at port in Mozambique with the goal of delivering the fertilizer from the port by mid-February 2007. As of this date, only 57,000 tonnes of the agreed 387,000 had arrived in the country.In 2006, the government of Zimbabwe agreed to mortgage the loan from China using platinum mining concessions from the Selous and Northfields Mines. The mining transactions were to occur through the Zimbabwe Mining Development Corporation (ZMDC) and Chinese mining firm Wanbao Mining. However, in a different US$200 million deal with Eximbank, also in 2006, these same mining areas were also up for collateral, causing both deals to stall. On July 11, 2009, Minister Biti signed another memorandum of understanding with the Chinese company Wanbao to free up the mining concessions in Selous and Northfields and allow Wanbao to being mining after the clarification and finalization of legal documentation between the Chinese and the Zimbabwean governments. The terms of the agreement include: the value of the commercial contract should be more than US$2 million.The portion of the Chinese content of exported goods should be no less than 50% of the total value. The cash payment (down payment) made by the importer to the Chinese exporter should not be less than 15% of the total contract value or 20% in the case of ship export contract. The export buyer's credit provided by the Eximbank of China for an export project of goods or services shall not exceed 85% of the total contract value, and 80% in the case of a ship export contract. Additional research into the completion date of the fertilizer delivery was unsuccessful. In 2007, a consignment of 1,000 more tractors and an assortment of other related farming implements worth $100 million USD from China was expected to arrive. The implements include harvesters, irrigation pumps, disc harrows, planters, and electricity generators. As of November of 2011, the facilities were being shipped from China to Zimbabwe. These goods compose the remaining value of the $200 million USD Chinese government loan. It appears that Zimbabwe purchased 97 trucks under the deal, but no financial value for the project was given. However, as of July 2012, it does appear that Zimbabwe defaulted on its repayment of the $200 million USD loan. China has extended the repayment period for the buyer's credit loan from five years to eight years.

Officials from the Ministry of Finance, representatives from China's Eximbank and Sinosure signed the agreement. Sinosure was to provide insurance cover for loans for projects supported by the Eximbank. On March 21, 2011 Zimbabwean Vice President Joice Mujuru signed a $144 million USD loan agreement for the development and rehabilitation of water works and sewers in the Zimbabwean capital, Harare. Specifically the funds would rehabilitate, replace, install and commission equipment at Morton Jaffray and Prince Edward Water Treatment plants and Crowborough and Firle Sewage plants. The project would be implemented by China National Machinery and Equipment Corporation (CNMEC) and funded by the China Eximbank. Some reports also mention the involvement of China Development Bank leaders in negotiations, although the role of the CDB in the project is unclear.

Later reports in December 2011 say that the Zimbabwean Cabinet had not yet approved the loan. Controversy arose as to whether the Chinese funding agencies had stipulated that the Zimbabwean local authority would have to pay an 8% interest of over USD $11 million in penalties due to delays in taking up the funds. Separate reports in 2012 and 2013 indicate the Harare City Council is yet to receive the funding, due to the government's failure to pay interest on a 1997 loan advanced to the then Zimbabwe Iron and Steel Industries. Other sources, such as town clerk Tendai Machachi, denied that the Chinese were making such demands. This project is linked to project ID#20980 for remaining funding spent on fertilizer supply. STAFF_NOTE: Projects under the loan included construction of 3 new dams, an additional water treatment plant, and refurbishment of existing facilities such as Prince Edward and Morton Jaffray which would increase output to 7-5 megalitres per day.

CCCC contends that the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Transport decided to call for new tenders before termination of the contract and awarded the tender to contractors other than the CCCC on grounds that the ministry had been directed by the Public Procurement Regulatory Authority not to deal with the company as it was among those banned by the World Bank. CCCC argues that it secured funding for the project from China Exim Bank and China and had invested a total of 523,131,015.97 USD in the contract.
